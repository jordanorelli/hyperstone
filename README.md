dota2 replay parser (WIP)

I abandoned this because I stopped playing Dota and working on Dota sabermetrics. If I go back to Dota I'll pick it up again. Decoding all of the entity changes is nearly complete. There are a few types that can't be decoded. Of course, there are no hooks to actually do anything with the data once it's decoded, so it's basically unusable unless you hard fork it and make a bunch of changes.
